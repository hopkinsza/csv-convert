.Sh NAME
.Nm csv-convert
.Nd convert a csv file to a more easily parseable format

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility takes a
.Sq csv
file on its standard input and outputs it in
a way that can be parsed more easily by tools such as
.Xr awk 1 .

.Pp
Because a field in the
.Sq csv
file format can be enclosed in double-quotes in order to include the delimiter
character (comma) and newlines, it can be difficult or impossible
to use with tools like
.Xr awk 1
that are designed to operate on files which contain each record on its own
line
.Po with each field within delimited by a designated delimiter character
that does not appear in any field
.Pc .

.Pp
.Nm
converts a
.Sq csv
file to just such a format. Each record is printed on its own line,
with fields delimited by commas. Within each field, the following substitutions
are made:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Dq \ec
for comma
.It
.Dq \en
for newline
.It
.Dq \e\e
for backslash
.El

.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success and 1 on failure.
