     The ccssvv--ccoonnvveerrtt utility takes a `csv' file on its standard input and
     outputs it in a way that can be parsed more easily by tools such as
     awk(1).


     Because a field in the `csv' file format can be enclosed in double-quotes
     in order to include the delimiter character (comma) and newlines, it can
     be difficult or impossible to use with tools like awk(1) that are
     designed to operate on files which contain each record on its own line
     (with each field within delimited by a designated delimiter character
     that does not appear in any field).


     ccssvv--ccoonnvveerrtt converts a `csv' file to just such a format. Each record is
     printed on its own line, with fields delimited by commas. Within each
     field, the following substitutions are made:

     ++oo   "\c" for comma

     ++oo   "\n" for newline

     ++oo   "\\" for backslash
